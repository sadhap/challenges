            <aside>
            💡 Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
            
            </aside>
            
            <aside>
            💡 Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
            versions)
            
            </aside>
            
            <aside>
            💡 Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
            whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
            Test data:
            § Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
            m tall.
            § Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
            m tall.

<div class="challenge-tow">
    <h2>challenge:2</h2>
    <p class="clge2"><aside>
        💡 Print a nice output to the console, saying who has a higher BMI. The message
        is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
        
        </aside>
        
        <aside>
        💡 Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
        BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
        Hint: Use an if/else statement 😉

        <h2>challenge:3</h2>
        <p class="clge3"><aside>
            💡 Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
            
            </aside>
            
            <aside>
            💡 Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
            and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
            as well (draw means they have the same average score)
            
            </aside>
            
            <aside>
            💡 Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
            team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
            score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
            score, as well as multiple else-if blocks 😉
            
            </aside>
            
            <aside>
            💡 Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
            both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal to 100
            points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
            Test data:
            § Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
            § Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
            § Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 10
            </aside>

        <h2>challenge:4</h2>
        <P class="clge4">
            <aside>
                💡 Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for
                this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement 😅 (If it's easier for you, you can
                start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary
                operator!)
                
                </aside>
                
                <aside>
                💡 Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value
                (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value
                316.25”
                Test data:
                § Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
                Hints:
                § To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
                § Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 😉
